Ever since I was introduced with the programming language , I grew interest on it so much that i always played with it and tried to solve mini problems by writing codes. Thinking deeply , figuring out the outline of the solution and finally implementing the problem in programming language is something that i always love to do. This deep connection with problem solving led me to solve more than 1000 codeforces problems. Here in each folder , almost 100 no of codes are given. 

Name of my handler in codeforces is "Mahim_1703003".
Here is total analysis of my Codeforces profile : https://cfviz.netlify.app/?handle=Mahim_1703003&fbclid=IwAR1cJRK4SNWUPGBBHy4js4t_HYNIYFJZt1BwbpI9-QkppZs6-mNokSwsV4Y
